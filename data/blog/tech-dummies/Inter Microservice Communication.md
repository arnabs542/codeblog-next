#### Problem

#### Inter Microservice Communication
###### 1. Synchronous
- Easy
- Realtime
- Service availability
- Response time can be more

###### 2. Asynchronous
- Faster APIs
- Decoupled services
- works even when services are down
- no need for service discovery
- complex design
- process latency
- monitoring costs
