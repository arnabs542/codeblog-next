##### Prerequisites
1. install `node` and `npm`
2. install `Xcode` for Mac
3. install any IDE (VS Code is preferred)

#### Setting up the development environment
We have 2 options
##### 1. Expo CLI
- If you are new to mobile development, the easiest way to get started is with Expo CLI.

```
npm install -g expo-cli
expo init myNewProject
cd myNewProject
expo start
```

```
npm start # you can open iOS, Android, or web from here, or run them directly with the commands below.
npm run android
npm run ios
npm run web
```

##### 2. React Native CLI
- If you are already familiar with mobile development, you may want to use React Native CLI. It requires Xcode or Android Studio to get started.
