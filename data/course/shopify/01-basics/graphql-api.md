#### GraphQL API
- GraphQL is a query language that uses fields and types to load a set of data from a client (e.g., Shopify).
- In Shopify, when you use REST, most of the time you will get data that you don't really need and this can cost you a lot and can slow down the performance of your application.

#### Query
- Reading data

#### Mutation
- Updating data
