## Volatile
The volatile concept is specific to Java.

If you have a variable say a `counter` that is being worked on by a thread, it is possible the thread keeps a copy of the `counter` variable in the CPU cache and manipulates it rather than writing to the main memory. The JVM will decide when to update the main memory with the value of the `counter`, even though other threads may read the value of the `counter` from the main memory and may end up reading a stale value.

If a variable is declared **volatile** then whenever a thread writes or reads to the volatile variable, the read and write always happen in the **main memory**. As a further guarantee, all the variables that are visible to the writing thread also get written-out to the main memory alongside the volatile variable. Similarly, all the variables visible to the reading thread alongside the volatile variable will have the latest values visible to the reading thread.

Volatile comes into play because of multiples levels of memory in hardware architecture required for performance enhancements. If there's a single thread that writes to the volatile variable and other threads only read the volatile variable then just using volatile is enough, however, if there's a possibility of multiple threads writing to the volatile variable then "synchronized" would be required to ensure atomic writes to the variable.
