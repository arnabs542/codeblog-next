#### Problem
Given a set of investment projects with their respective profits, we need to find the **most profitable projects**. We are given an **initial capital** and are allowed to invest only in a **fixed number of projects**. Our goal is to choose projects that give us the **maximum profit**.

We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital. Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our capital.
```
Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2], Project Profits=[1,2,3], Initial Capital=1, Number of Projects=2
Output: 6
Input: Project Capitals=[0,1,2,3], Project Profits=[1,2,3,5], Initial Capital=0, Number of Projects=3
Output: 8
```

#### Method: Two Heaps
While selecting projects we have two constraints:
1. We can select a project only when we have the required capital.
2. There is a maximum limit on how many projects we can select.

Since we donâ€™t have any constraint on time, we should choose a project, among the projects for which we have enough capital, which gives us a maximum profit. Following this greedy approach will give us the best solution.

While selecting a project, we will do two things:
1. Find all the projects that we can choose with the available capital.
2. From the list of projects in the 1st step, choose the project that gives us a maximum profit.

We can follow the **Two Heaps** approach similar to Find the Median of a Number Stream. Here are the steps of our algorithm:
1. Add all project capitals to a min-heap, so that we can select a project with the smallest capital requirement.
2. Go through the top projects of the min-heap and filter the projects that can be completed within our available capital. Insert the profits of all these projects into a max-heap, so that we can choose a project with the maximum profit.
3. Finally, select the top project of the max-heap for investment.
4. Repeat the 2nd and 3rd steps for the required number of projects.

```java
import java.util.*;

class MaximizeCapital {
  public static int findMaximumCapital(int[] capital, int[] profits, int numberOfProjects, int initialCapital) {
    int n = profits.length;
    PriorityQueue<Integer> minCapitalHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(n, (i1, i2) -> capital[i1] - capital[i2]);
    PriorityQueue<Integer> maxProfitHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(n, (i1, i2) -> profits[i2] - profits[i1]);
    // insert all project capitals indexes to a min-heap
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
      minCapitalHeap.offer(i);
    int availableCapital = initialCapital;
    for (int i = 0; i < numberOfProjects; i++) {
      // find all projects that can be selected within the available capital and insert them in a max-heap
      while (!minCapitalHeap.isEmpty() && capital[minCapitalHeap.peek()] <= availableCapital)
        maxProfitHeap.add(minCapitalHeap.poll());
      // terminate if we are not able to find any project that can be completed within the available capital
      if (maxProfitHeap.isEmpty())
        break;
      // select the project with the maximum profit
      availableCapital += profits[maxProfitHeap.poll()];
    }
    return availableCapital;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int result = MaximizeCapital.findMaximumCapital(new int[] { 0, 1, 2 }, new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }, 2, 1);
    System.out.println("Maximum capital: " + result);
    result = MaximizeCapital.findMaximumCapital(new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3 }, new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 5 }, 3, 0);
    System.out.println("Maximum capital: " + result);
  }
}
```
**Time complexity:** `O(N)`
