## Stack Implementations
- Stacks can either be implemented using arrays or linked lists.
- Stacks are generally implemented using arrays because it takes less space, we donâ€™t need to store an additional pointer like in a linked list.

### 1. Basic Stack using Array

### 2. Generic Stack using Array

### Core Java Stacks
1. `Stack<E>` - It uses **Vector** as the underlying stack structure.
2. `Deque<E>` - Various implementations like ArrayDeque
