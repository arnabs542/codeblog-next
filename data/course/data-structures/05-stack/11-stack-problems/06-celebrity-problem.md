### Problem
Celebrity Problem. Find the celebrity in a party (matrix) using a stack. A celebrity is someone that everyone knows, but he/she doesn’t know anyone at the party.
```
int findCelebrity(int[][] party,int numPeople);
```

Where the party is a reference variable storing a 2D matrix, which has stored all the information about acquaintances, numPeople and the number of people present in the party.

_if [row][col] == 1, then it means row knows col, and if it’s zero, then it means row doesn’t know col._
