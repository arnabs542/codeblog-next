#### Problem
In a **Red-Black Tree**, the maximum height of a node is at most twice the minimum height.
Given a Binary Search Tree, we need to check for following property.
_For every node, length of the longest leaf to node path has not more than twice the nodes on shortest path from node to leaf._

##### Method 1:
1. For every node, we need to get the maximum and minimum heights and compare them.
2. The idea is to traverse the tree and for every node check if itâ€™s balanced.
3. We need to write a recursive function that returns three things, a boolean value to indicate the tree is balanced or not, minimum height and maximum height.
4. To return multiple values, we can either use a structure or pass variables by reference.
5. We have passed maxh and minh by reference so that the values can be used in parent calls.
