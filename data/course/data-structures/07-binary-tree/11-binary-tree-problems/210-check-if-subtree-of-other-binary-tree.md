#### Problem
Given two binary trees, check if the first tree is subtree of the second one. A **subtree of a tree** T is a tree S consisting of a node in T and all of its descendants in T.

---
##### Method 1:
The idea is based on the fact that inorder and preorder/postorder uniquely identify a binary tree. Tree S is a subtree of T if both inorder and preorder traversals of S arew substrings of inorder and preorder traversals of T respectively.
1) Find inorder and preorder traversals of T, store them in two auxiliary arrays inT[] and preT[].
2) Find inorder and preorder traversals of S, store them in two auxiliary arrays inS[] and preS[].
3) If inS[] is a subarray of inT[] and preS[] is a subarray preT[], then S is a subtree of T. Else not.

> Time Complexity: O(n)
