#### Shortest Path Algorithms
Given a graph G = (V,E) and a distinguished vertex s, we need to find the shortest path from s to every other vertex in G.

##### Variations of Shortest Path Algorithms
1. Shortest path in unweighted graph
2. Shortest path in weighted graph
3. Shortest path in weighted graph with negative edges

##### Applications of Shortest Path Algorithms
1. Finding fastest way to go from one place to another
2. Finding cheapest way to fly/send data from one place to another
