#### Disjoint Set
- A disjoint-set is a data structure that keeps track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
- A union-find algorithm is an algorithm that performs two useful operations on such a data structure

##### Applications


##### Operations on Disjoint Set
1. **MAKESET**: Create a new set containing a single element X.
2. **UNION**: Creates a new set containing the element X and Y with their union and deletes the sets containing X and Y.
3. **FIND**: Returns name of set containing element X.

There are 2 ways of implementing FIND/UNION operations:
1. Quick Find
2. Quick Union
