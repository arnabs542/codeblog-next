#### Control Flow
##### Conditional statements
1. `if` statement
2. `else` clause

---
#### Loops
##### While loop
- 
```python
c = 5
while c:
    print(c)
    c -= 1
```

##### for loop
- visits each item in an iterable sequence
```python
>>> a = [12, 13, 14, 15]
>>> for n in a:
... print(n)
```

##### break
- break jumps out of the inner-most executing loop to the line immediately after it.
