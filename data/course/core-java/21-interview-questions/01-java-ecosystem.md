## Java & it's Ecosystem
#### What is meant by the statement Java is platform independent?
- Java works on the principle of **write once and run anywhere**. Once a Java program is written, it gets compiled into what is known as the byte code, which can then be run on any Java Virtual Machine or JVM for short.
- Compilation to bytecode is the magic behind Java's interoperability. Different operating systems and hardware architectures have JVMs custom designed for themselves and all JVMs can run the same bytecode. Therefore, if you write a Java program on Linux, it will run seamlessly on a JVM designed for Windows operating system, making code agnostic to the underlying hardware and OS.

#### What is meant by the Java platform?
- Java is both a programming language as well as a software platform. The platform consists of:
1. Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
2. Java Application Programming Interface (Java API)

Examples:
1. Java Standard Edition
2. Java Enterprise Edition

#### What is the Java language specification?
- Language specification is an official document that gives detailed description of the syntax and semantics of a particular language.
- Java publishes Java language specifications and the virtual machine specifications for various editions.
- Note:
  - Every specification may not necessarily have an implementation in the JDK (for example JPA, JAX-RS).
  - Third party vendors can also participate in implementing the specification.
  - An actual implementation of the specification can be a superset of the original specification i.e. it can offer more than the specification but shouldn't contradict the specification.

#### What is the Java API?
- Java API is a large collection of ready-made software components that provide many useful capabilities that comes prepackaged with the Java development kit.
- It is grouped into libraries of related classes and interfaces known as packages.
- These APIs enable Java programs to access the local file system, the network and other basic functionality which one would otherwise have had to program oneself. These APIs cut down development time.
- The standard Java APIs come bundled with the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or with the Java SDK which also includes a JRE.

#### What is the Java Runtime Environment?
- The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) includes the **Java Virtual Machine** and the **standard Java APIs** (core classes and supporting files.).
- The JRE contains just enough to execute a Java application, but not to compile it.
- JRE consists of Java platform libraries, Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java Plugin and Java Web Start to run Java applications.
- JRE as a stand-alone does not contain compilers and debugging tools.

#### What is the Java Development Kit or JDK?
- The Java Software Development Kit (Java SDK) is JRE plus the Java compiler, and a set of other tools to debug Java code for developing Java applications.
- If you need to develop Java programs you need the full Java SDK. The JRE is not enough for program development. Only the full Java SDK contains the Java compiler which turns your .java source files into byte code .class files.

#### Does Java's platform independence affect its performance?
- As a platform-independent environment, the Java platform can be a bit slower than native code.
- Converting byte code to machine code incurs a performance penalty.
- Additionally, Java is a memory managed language which requires cleaning up of the memory space periodically by the platform, resulting in reduced application throughput.
- However, advancements in compiler and virtual machine technologies are bringing performance close to that of native code without threatening portability.

## Java Virtual Machine
#### What is the Java Virtual Machine or JVM?
**The Java virtual machine is an implementation of a specification, detailing the behavior expected of a JVM.** Any implementation that conforms to the JVM specification should be able to run code compiled into Java bytecode irrespective of the language in which the code was originally written. The Java Virtual Machine is implemented for several different operating systems, like Windows, Mac OS, Linux, IBM mainframes, Solaris etc. Thus, if your Java program can run on a Java Virtual Machine on Windows, it can normally also run on a Java Virtual Machine on Mac OS or Linux. Note that the JVM is a program itself that can be invoked on the command line and instructed to execute a file containing java bytecode.

In the Java programming language, all source code is first written in plain text files ending with the `.java` extension. Those source files are then compiled into `.class` files by the **javac** compiler. A `.class` file does not contain code that is native to your processor; it instead contains bytecodes â€” the machine language of the Java Virtual Machine. The java launcher tool then runs your application with an instance of the Java Virtual Machine.

The JVM is by definition a virtual machine or an abstract computer, i. e. a software machine that simulates what a real machine does. Like a real machine, it has an instruction set, a virtual computer architecture and an execution model. It is capable of running code written with this virtual instruction set, pretty much like a real machine can run machine code.

**In practice, JRE is the implementation of the Java Virtual Machine. The JRE contains the JVM and java binaries and other classes to execute any program successfully.**

## Describe JVM architecture?
The Java Virtual Machine consists of three components:
- **Class Loader Subsystem:** The part of a Java virtual machine implementation that takes care of finding and loading types is called the class loader subsystem. The class loader subsystem is responsible for more than just locating and importing the binary data for classes. It must also verify the correctness of imported classes, allocate and initialize memory for class variables, and assist in the resolution of symbolic references. (See a more detailed explanation under the class loader section.)
- **Runtime Data Area:** The memory areas allocated by the JVM are called Runtime Data Area. These consist of method area, heap area, stack, pc registers and native stack. (See a more detailed explanation under the memory management section.)
- **Execution Engine:** The execution is responsible for the actual execution of the bytecode. It consists of three components: interpreter, just-in-time compiler and the garbage collector.

#### If we launch two Java programs on the same machine, how many instances of JVM would be created?
A runtime instance of the Java virtual machine runs a single Java application. When a Java application starts, a runtime instance is born. When the application completes, the instance dies. **If you start three Java applications at the same time, on the same computer, using the same concrete implementation, you'll get three Java virtual machine instances. Each Java application runs inside its own Java virtual machine.**

#### Can you give a few examples of JVM implementations?
A large amount of Java development work takes place on Windows, Solaris, Linux, and FreeBSD, primarily with the Oracle JVMs. In fact, Oracle's Hotspot implementation of JVM is used as a reference. Additionally, there are 32 and 64-bit varities of JVM. Some implementations of the JVM have been discontinued by their sponsors and aren't active. Some active implementations of the JVM are listed below:
- **Amazon's Corretto JVM implementation** - https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/
- **CACAO JVM implementation** - http://www.cacaojvm.org/
- **IBM's OpenJ9 JVM implementation** - https://www.eclipse.org/openj9/
- **Azul System's Zulu JVM implementation** - https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?architecture=x86-64-bit&package=jdk

**JRockit** is a discontinued implementation of the JVM. Twitter and SAP also have their implementations of the JVM specifications.

#### What are JVM languages?
JVM runs bytecode. The **Java compiler** converts code written in the Java language to bytecode. Similarly, other languages can take advantage of the Java platform if they have a compiler to convert code written in their respective languages to bytecode. For instance, **Jython** is an implementation of the Python language for the Java platform and a program written in Jython can run on any Java platform. **JRuby** is another example, which is an implementation of the Ruby programming language atop the JVM. Such languages that can run on the Java platform are called JVM languages. Here's a list on Wikipedia.

#### What is Java Hotspot?
HotSpot is one of the most popular implementations of the JVM concept. It was originally developed by Sun and now is owned by Oracle. There are two editions available:
- Oracle Hotspot
- OpenJDK Hotspot

Sun open sourced and donated the Hotspot JVM source code which became the OpenJDK project. Implementations by OpenJDK serve as reference implementation.

There's not too many differences between the two as Oracle's Hotspot is based on OpenJDK's Hotspot project and comes with additional bells and whistles for paying customers. **The JVM implementation is called HotSpot because it continually analyzes the program's performance for hot spots of code (code paths which are executed repeatedly). The repeating code paths are compiled into very highly optimized native machine code for faster execution.**

You can check the installed JVM version on your machine using the **`java -version`** command. On my machine the output appears below:
```
bin/java -version
```

The output shows that the version of the JRE as well as the JVM Hotspot version. Note separate Hotspot JVM implementations exist for server and client environments. In the above screenshot, the JVM identifies itself as the Server VM. The Java HotSpot Client VM has been specially tuned to reduce application start-up time and memory footprint, making it particularly well suited for client environments. The Java HotSpot Server VM is similar to the Java HotSpot Client VM, except that it has been specially tuned to maximize peak operating speed. It is intended for running long-running server applications, for which having the fastest possible operating speed is generally more important than having the fastest possible start-up time. These two solutions share the Java HotSpot runtime environment code base but use different compilers that are suited to the distinctly unique performance characteristics of clients and servers. On a 64-bit capable JDK, only the Java Hotspot Server VM is supported.

#### What is the execution engine?
The execution engine is responsible for executing bytecode. The execution engine is one part of the virtual machines that can vary in different JVM implementations. The most used JVMs have three components of the execution engine:
- Interpreter
- Just in Time Compiler
- Garbage Collector

The simplest kind of execution engine just interprets the bytecodes one at a time.

Another kind of execution engine, one that is faster but requires more memory, comes with a just-in-time compiler. In this scheme, the bytecodes of a method are compiled to native machine code the first time the method is invoked. The native machine code for the method is then cached, so it can be re-used the next time that same method is invoked.

The third type of execution engine is an adaptive optimizer. In this approach, the virtual machine starts by interpreting bytecodes, but monitors the activity of the running program and identifies the most heavily used areas of code. As the program runs, the virtual machine compiles to native and optimizes just these heavily used areas. The rest of the of code, which is not heavily used, remains as bytecodes which the virtual machine continues to interpret.

The garbage collector is discussed at length in the memory management section of the course.

#### What is the Java interpreter?
**The Java Interpreter can be thought of as a translator that converts Java bytecode into native machine code. The translation of bytecodes to native machine code is done line by line.**

The Java interpreter is actually a part of the JVM. For each hardware architecture, a different Java bytecode interpreter is needed. When a computer has a Java bytecode interpreter, it can run any Java bytecode program, and the same program can be run on any computer that has such an interpreter.

When Java bytecode is executed by an interpreter, the execution will always be slower than the execution of the same program compiled into native machine language. This problem is mitigated by just-in-time (JIT) compilers for executing Java bytecode.

#### Explain the working of the JIT compiler?
**A JIT compiler runs after the program has started and compiles the code (usually bytecode or some kind of VM instructions) on the fly (or just-in-time, as it's called) into a form that's usually faster, typically the host CPU's native instruction set. A JIT compiler has access to dynamic runtime information whereas a standard compiler doesn't and can make better optimizations like inlining functions that are used frequently. This is in contrast to a traditional compiler that compiles all the code to machine language before the program is run for the first time.**

Java programs consist of classes, which contain platform-neutral bytecodes that can be interpreted by a JVM on many different computer architectures. **The JIT compiler helps improve the performance of Java programs by compiling bytecodes into native machine code at run time.** The exact behavior of the JIT compiler is hard to predict and documentation is scarce, however, the general theme on which JITs work is presented here. When a method has been compiled, the JVM calls the compiled code of that method directly instead of interpreting it. Theoretically, if the compilation did not require processor time and memory usage, compiling every method could allow the speed of the Java program to approach that of a native application.

JIT compilation does require processor time and memory usage. When the JVM first starts up, thousands of methods are called. Compiling all of these methods can significantly affect startup time, even if the program eventually achieves very good peak performance. In practice, methods are not compiled the first time they are called. For each method, the JVM maintains an invocation count, which starts at a predefined compilation threshold value and is decremented every time the method is called. When the invocation count reaches zero, a just-in-time compilation for the method is triggered. Therefore, often-used methods are compiled soon after the JVM has started, and less-used methods are compiled much later, or not at all. You can disable the JIT compiler, in which case the entire Java program will be interpreted.

JIT is not actually part of the JVM standard, it is, nonetheless, an essential component of Java.

Usually JIT compilers employ a sophisticated, low-cost, sampling-based technique to identify which functions merit optimization. A "sampler thread" wakes up at periodic intervals and checks the status of several application threads. It identifies what each thread is executing and notes some of the execution history. This information is tracked for all the methods and when it is perceived that a method is experiencing heavy use or in other words, becomes hot â€” that method is slated for optimization. Usually, a flurry of such optimization opportunities occurs in the applicationâ€™s early run stages, with the rate slowing down as execution continues.

## Java Flavors & Processes
#### What is Java SE?
The SE stands for standard edition. We know that the Java platform is a suite of programs that facilitate developing and running programs written in the Java programming language. All Java platforms consist of a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and an application programming interface (API). Don't confuse the Java programming language with the Java platform. The programming language is one part of the Java platform. Since Java is independent of the underlying OS and hardware, there exist different versions of the platform that target specific devices and use-cases.

A Java platform edition is defined by a specification that describes APIs and their interactions. For instance, the Java SE edition specifications can be seen here. Any vendor is free to implement the specification. For instance, there's one called Zulu, which is Java SE 11 compliant. Similarly, Oracle has their own implementation that can be downloaded from here.

As a developer or a user, you'll be required to download either a JRE or JDK belonging to the edition you intend to use. The Java Standard Edition contains the basic Java APIs for standalone desktop and command line applications and can be used on desktop PCs, servers, and similar devices.

#### What is OpenJDK?
Open Java development kit is a free and open-source implementation of the Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), and the base for the Oracle JDK. OpenJDK is the official reference implementation for Java Standard Edition from Java SE 7. In fact, Oracle JDKâ€™s builds from OpenJDK source code and so do other vendors. There is no major technical difference between Oracle JDK and OpenJDK. Most of the vendors of JDK are written on top of OpenJDK by doing a few tweaks to replace either licensed proprietary parts or more high-performance items that only work on specific OS components.

The OpenJDK project came into being as a result of Sun open sourcing Java

#### What is Java EE?
Java EE is a specification describing a collection of technologies and APIs for the Java platform designed to support enterprise applications which can generally be classified as large-scale, multi-tiered, distributed, transactional, and highly-available applications for mission-critical business requirements. Technologies implementing and complying with Java EE specification include for instance GlassFish or IBM's WebSphere.

These implementations are the so-called Java EE Containers. When you hear people saying that "GlassFish is a Java EE 1.8 implementation" they mean that GlassFish (a Java program written using the Java Standard Edition classes) provides all the features that the Java EE 8 family of specifications define. A Java EE application needs a Java EE compatible server (such as GlassFish or Websphere) in addition to the JVM to run. Note, the Java EE platform is built on top of the Java SE platform and runs on the Java SE runtime i.e. Java SE JRE.

#### What is Java ME?
The ME stands for micro edition. The Java ME platform provides an API and a small-footprint virtual machine for running Java programming language applications on small devices, like mobile phones. The API is a subset of the Java SE API, along with special class libraries useful for small device application development. Java ME applications are often clients of Java EE platform services.

#### What is Java FX?
JavaFX is a platform for creating rich internet applications using a lightweight user-interface API. JavaFX applications use hardware-accelerated graphics and media engines to take advantage of higher-performance clients and a modern look-and-feel as well as high-level APIs for connecting to networked data sources. JavaFX applications may be clients of Java EE platform services. It's speculated that the FX in the name refers to special "EFF-ECTS".

#### What is JCP?
The Java Community Process (JCP), established in 1998, is a formalized mechanism that allows interested parties to develop standard technical specifications for Java technology. Anyone can become a JCP Member by filling a form available at the JCP website. JCP membership for organizations and commercial entities requires annual fees but is free for individuals.

#### What is JSR?
The JCP involves the use of **Java Specification Requests (JSRs) â€“ the formal documents that describe proposed specifications and technologies for adding to the Java platform.** Formal public reviews of JSRs take place before a JSR becomes final and the JCP Executive Committee votes on it. A final JSR provides a reference implementation that is a free implementation of the technology in source code form and a Technology Compatibility Kit to verify the API specification.

#### What is TCK?
**A Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK) is a suite of tests that nominally checks if a claimed implementation of a Java Specification Request (JSR) is compliant.** The Technology Compatibility Kit for a particular Java platform is called Java Compatibility Kit (JCK). It is an extensive test suite used by Oracle and licensees to ensure compatible implementations of the platform.

Under the JCP process, release of a new or revised technology specification must contain three primary components:
- **Specification:** A written specification of technology. There are different kinds of specifications, for example platform editions, profiles and optional packages.
- **Reference Implementation (RI):** The prototype or proof of concept implementation of the specification. The RI is required to pass the TCK.
- **Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK):** A test kit that Java technology implementors can use to ensure that their work is conformant with the technology specification. The TCK must test all aspects of a specification that impact how conformant an implementation of that specification would be, such as the public API and all elements of the specification. A vendor's implementation of a specification is only considered conformant if the implementation passes the TCK.

## Java Tools & Files
#### What are .class files? or What is Java bytecode?
The java compiler compiles the `.java` files into `.class` files. The `.class` files contain what is known as the java bytecode. Then the bytecode can be run by the JVM. **Java bytecode is the instruction set of the Java virtual machine.**

#### What are .jar files?
A JAR (Java Archive) is a package file format used to aggregate many Java class files and associated metadata and resources (text, images, etc.) into one file for distribution. A jar file is built on the ZIP format and typically has a .jar file extension. The jar tool can be used to create `.jar` file.

#### What is a fat jar?
Fat jar, or uber jar, is a jar which contains all project class files and classes from all the libraries, on which the project depends.

#### What is JCL?
JCL stands for Java Class Library. It is a set of dynamically loadable libraries that Java applications can call at run time. JCL includes fundamental classes such as `java.lang.String`, `java.lang.Thread`, `java.util.ArrayList` and all the other classes from Java API. Almost all of JCL is stored in a single Java archive file called `rt.jar` (classes.jar on mac) runtime jar for short, which is provided with JRE and JDK distributions. Starting from Java 9 the `rt.jar` file has been broken into several smaller modules.

#### What is a .hprof file?
HProf is a tool built into JDK for profiling the CPU and heap usage within a JVM. A Java process crash may produce an `.hprof` file containing a heap dump of the process at the time of the failure.
