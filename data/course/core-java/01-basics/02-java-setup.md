#### Packaging Java Applications
##### JAR
- Java applications are packaged into JAR files (Java Archive)
- JAR file contains compiled classes containing platform independent bytecode generated by Java Compiler.
- JAR file can also contains extra metadata stored in META-INF -> MANIFEST.MF file

##### How to create JAR file
- There is a tool in JDK called jar, which we can use to create JAR files.
  - `jar cvf AppName.jar .`

#### Tools

##### IDEs
1. Eclipse
2. IntelliJ

##### Unit Testing
1. JUnit
2. Mockito

##### Build Tools
1. Maven
    - Describes build in an XML file called pom.xml
    - Maven runs on development machine, but it talks to Maven Central which contains all Java libraries in existance. 
2. Gradle
    - Define builds using Groovy scripts.
    - It supports incremental builds. It will only build a piece of code, if the previously compiled version is outdated.
    - It can also use Maven Central
    - It is default build system for Android applications
    
##### Continuous Integration & Quality Control
1. Checkstyle
2. Spotbugs
3. PMD
4. SonarQube
