## Class diagram

- **Meal:** Each order will consist of separate meals for each table seat.
- **Meal Item:** Each Meal will consist of one or more meal items corresponding to a menu item.
- **Account:** Weâ€™ll have different types of accounts in the system, one will be a receptionist to search and reserve tables and the other, the waiter will place orders in the system.
